##What we need to accomplish 
* create an HTTP server using the native NodeJS `http` module
* create an object constructor that creates a _simple resource_ with at least 3 properties
  * include an `id` property that is set to a unique id (**hint:** you'll need to use `uuid`)
  * include two additional properties of your choice (ex: name, content, etc.)
* create a custom body parser module that uses promises to parse the JSON body of `POST` and `PUT` requests
* create a custom url parser module that returns a promise and uses the NodeJS `url` and `querystring` modules to parse the request url
* create a router constructor that handles requests to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
* create a storage module that will store resources by their schema type (ex: note) and id
